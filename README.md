# 🚗 Car Rental Management System (Python)

This is a simple **Car Rental Management System** implemented in Python using object-oriented programming principles. It allows tracking of cars, customers, and rental transactions.

## 📌 Features

* Maintain a list of **cars** with their details and availability status.
* Manage **customers** and their rented cars.
* Allow customers to **rent** and **return** cars.
* Track **rental transactions** with fees.

## 🧠 How It Works

The program contains three main classes:

### `Car`

Represents a car in the system.

* Attributes: `car_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`, `available`
* Methods: `rent()`, `return_car()`

### `Customer`

Represents a customer who rents cars.

* Attributes: `customer_id`, `name`, `rented_cars`
* Methods: `rent_car(car)`, `return_car(car)`

### `Rental`

Tracks individual rental transactions.

* Attributes: `rental_id`, `customer`, `car`, `rental_fee`

## 🛠 Usage

1. **Initialize cars and customers.**
2. Customers **rent** cars using `rent_car()`.
3. Rentals are stored in a list with unique rental IDs and rental fees.
4. Customers can **return** cars.
5. The program prints:

   * Initial rented cars by each customer.
   * Updated list after returns.
   * Summary of all rental transactions.

## ✅ Example Output

```
Adarsh Wahewal's Rented Cars: ['Innova']
...
Pratham Shambharkar's Rented Cars: ['Roxx']
...
Rental ID:R001, Customer:Adarsh Wahewal, Car:Innova, Rental fee: INR 5000.0
```

## 🔧 Requirements

* Python 3.x

No external libraries are required.

## 📂 File Structure

```
main.py         # Main Python program for car rental logic
```
